<p>Before you upload photos to the web, you might want to check if you don't give out too much information. Cameras, smartphones and other hardware does not only store the image information but also the time and date, what camera was used and possibly even the location on the planet in every image in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">EXIF</a> data.</p>
<p>Using this tool you can see this data, and download an image that has all of it removed to send out.</p>
<p><strong>Your photo does not get uploaded anywhere, all of this happens on your device, in your browser. It even works offline.</strong></p>
<p>Simply browse for your photo here and you get all the information in it. Then click the "Download clean image" link to get the image with all this information stripped from it. If there is no extra data in the image, it will tell you so.</p>
